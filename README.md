**Pyperplan** is a lightweight STRIPS planner written in Python.

Please note that Pyperplan deliberately prefers clean code over fast
code. It is designed to be used as a teaching or prototyping tool. If
you use it for paper experiments, please state clearly that Pyperplan
does not offer state-of-the-art performance.

It was developed during the planning practical course at
Albert-Ludwigs-Universit채t Freiburg during the winter term 2010/2011 and
is published under the terms of the GNU General Public License 3
(GPLv3).

Pyperplan supports the following PDDL fragment: STRIPS without action
costs.

# Requirements

Pyperplan requires [Python](https://python.org) >= 3.7.

# Installation

From the Python package index (PyPI):

    pip install pyperplan

From inside a repository clone:

    pip install --editable .

This makes the `pyperplan` command available globally or in your [virtual
environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) (recommended).

# Usage

The `pyperplan` executable accepts two arguments: a PDDL domain file and a
PDDL problem file. Example:

    pyperplan benchmarks/tpp/domain.pddl benchmarks/tpp/task01.pddl

The domain file can be omitted, in which case the planner will attempt
to guess its name based on the problem file. If a plan is found, it is
stored alongside the problem file with a .soln extension.

By default, the planner performs a blind breadth-first search, which
does not scale very well. Heuristic search algorithms are available. For
example, to use greedy-best-first search with the FF heuristic, run

    pyperplan -H hff -s gbf DOMAIN PROBLEM

For a list of available search algorithms and heuristics, run

    pyperplan --help

For more information on using the planner and how to extend it to do
more fancy stuff, see the [documentation](doc/documentation.md).

# FAQs

## PDDL types

Pyperplan follows the semantics that all types other than the universal
supertype object (which is mentioned as such in the PDDL 1.2 paper) need
to be explicitly introduced.
